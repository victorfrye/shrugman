### .NET Aspire

This project optionally uses .NET Aspire to orchestrate the local development environment. This will be expanded upon in the future to add additional features include OpenTelemetry and other backing cloud services.

For more information on or troubleshooting .NET Aspire, see the [Aspire documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview).
